section 1: introduction 
in 1999, the global industry classification standard (gics) was developed by msci in collaboration 
with s&amp;p dow jones indices to provide an efficient, detailed and flexible tool for use in the 
investment process. it is designed to respond to the global financial community’s need for a global, 
accurate, complete and widely accepted approach to defining industries and classifying securities 
by industry. its universal approach to industry classification aims to improve transparency and 
efficiency in the investment process. 
the key features of the gics structure are that it is: 
• 
universal: the structure applies to companies globally. 
• 
reliable: the structure correctly reflects the current state of industries in the equity 
investment universe. 
• 
flexible: the structure offers four levels of analysis, ranging from the most general sector to the 
most specialized sub-industry. 
• 
evolving: annual reviews are conducted by msci and s&amp;p dow jones indices to ensure that the 
structure remains fully representative of today’s global markets. 
• 
the gics structure presented in this document is the latest structure post our recent major 
reviews that included the creation of a new sector for real estate that was carved out from the 
financials sector and transformation of the telecommunication services sector as the 
communication services sector.">

1.3 philosophy and objectives of gics 
the way in which securities are classified into asset classes forms the basis of many important 
investment decisions. the relative merits of each security are judged primarily within these asset 
classes, and investment decisions are taken within this framework. 
 
approaches to industry classification schemes 
grouping companies based on industries is not a relatively straightforward task as multiple factors 
need to be evaluated in determining the classification that aptly reflects the business model of the 
company as well as adds value to the investment process. there are many approaches to developing 
industry classification schemes, some of which are discussed below. 
at one extreme is the purely statistical approach, which is solely financial market- based and backward 
looking, using past returns. aggregations are formed around correlation, often yielding non-intuitive 
groupings that are dissimilar across countries and regions. another approach attempts to define a 
priori financial market-oriented groups or themes, such as cyclical, interest rate sensitive, etc. the 
difficulty, however, lies in finding widely accepted and relatively stable definitions for these themes. 
two other approaches begin with an economic perspective on companies. the first focuses on a 
production orientation while the other adopts a market or demand orientation in company analysis. 
the production-oriented approach was effective in the past in its analysis of the microstructure of 
industries from the producers’ standpoint. for instance, it segregated goods and services on the 
premise that it was a different set of companies that provided each to consumers. as the structure of 
the global economy evolved, limitations of this approach became increasingly obvious. the ever-
increasing share of discretionary income brought about by economic development, emergence of the 
service era, and the availability and accessibility of information with the advent of new communication 
technology has moved the emphasis from producers to consumers. 
 
the gics: market demand-oriented 
the global industry classification standard is designed to be market demand- oriented in its 
analysis and classification of companies. for example, drawing the line between goods and services 
is becoming increasingly arbitrary as they are now commonly sold together. this distinction between 
goods and services is replaced by adopting the more market-oriented sectors of “consumer 
discretionary” and “consumer staples”, which group goods and services sub-industries. 
in addition, the creation of large stand-alone sectors such as health care, information technology 
and communication services accurately represents industries that provide significant value to the 
consumer in today’s global and integrated economy. this further contributes to a more uniform 
distribution of weights among the 11 gics sectors.">

section 3: guidelines for gics classification 
the gics is strictly hierarchical and thus a company can only belong to one grouping at each of the 
four levels. 
 
3.1 classification by revenue and earnings 
in order to provide an accurate, complete and long-term view of the global investment universe, 
a company’s revenues often provide a more stable and precise reflection of its activities than 
earnings. furthermore, industrial and geographical breakdowns of revenues are more 
commonly available than earnings broken down the same way for most companies. 
nevertheless, company valuations are more closely related to earnings than revenues. 
therefore, earnings remain an important secondary consideration in a company’s industry 
classification. in addition to revenue and earnings, market perception is also recognized as 
relevant for classification purposes. 
as a general rule, a company is classified in the sub-industry whose definition most closely 
describes the business activities that generate more than 60% of the company’s revenues.

however, a company engaged in two or more substantially different business activities, none of 
which contribute 60% or more of revenues, is classified in the sub- industry that provides the 
majority of both the company’s revenues and earnings.">

corporate bonds 
propagation of gics from company level to security level 
gics is assigned at the company level and thus all securities, equities or corporate bonds,

each corporate bond issuer is assigned to a gics sub-industry based on the gics of its 
related listed entity, i.e., its parent company or ultimate parent company, as available in gics 
direct. 
 
example: gics of corporate bond issued by coca-cola refreshments usa inc. 
coca-cola refreshments usa inc.’s parent is coca-cola co which is classified as “30201030 
- soft drinks”.

in cases where the related entities, i.e., its parent and ultimate parent company don’t have 
gics in gics direct, the corporate bond issuer will be classified based on its own or its 
related entities’ underlying business using the gics framework. 
 
in addition, if the corporate bond issuer is a special purpose vehicle or a captive finance 
vehicle, it will be classified based on the business of its related entities as described in 
section 3.">

8.2 source of information used for the gics classification of 
fixed income 
the primary source of information used to classify fixed income securities is the company’s annual 
reports and accounts. other sources include broker reports and other published research literature. 
in the case of a new issue, the classification will be determined based primarily on the description of 
the company’s activities and pro forma results as given in the prospectus. 
 
8.3 maintenance of gics for companies that have issued 
corporate bonds 
8.3.1 ongoing review 
a company’s sub-industry classification will be reviewed at least annually. it will also be 
reviewed when a significant corporate restructuring occurs. gics reviews could also occur 
upon client request. 
in order to provide a stable sub-industry classification, when reviewing a company’s 
classification, changes will be minimized in the sub-industry classification to the extent 
possible by disregarding temporary fluctuations in the results of a company’s different 
activities. 
 
8.3.2 impact of gics structure review 
all changes in the gics structure and definitions resulting from a structure review will be 
applicable to the classification of companies that have issued fixed income securities as well.">

even if notified of the possibility of such damages. the foregoing shall not exclude or limit any liability that may not by applicable law be excluded 
or limited, including without limitation (as applicable), any liability for death or personal injury to the extent that such injury results from the 
negligence or willful default of itself, its servants, agents or sub-contractors.    
• 
information containing any historical information, data or analysis should not be taken as an indication or guarantee of any future 
performance, analysis, forecast or prediction.  past performance does not guarantee future results.    
• 
the information may include “signals,” defined as quantitative attributes or the product of methods or formulas that describe or are derived 
from calculations using historical data. neither these signals nor any description of historical data are intended to provide investment advice or a 
recommendation to make (or refrain from making) any investment decision or asset allocation and should not be relied upon as such. signals are 
inherently backward-looking because of their use of historical data, and they are not intended to predict the future. the relevance, correlations and

it is not possible to invest directly in an index.  exposure to an asset class or trading strategy or other category represented by an index is 
only available through third party investable instruments (if any) based on that index.   msci does not issue, sponsor, endorse, market, offer, review

is not an investment adviser or fiduciary and msci makes no representation regarding the advisability of investing in any index linked investments.  
• 
index returns do not represent the results of actual trading of investible assets/securities. msci maintains and calculates indexes, but does 
not manage actual assets. the calculation of indexes and index returns may deviate from the stated methodology. index returns do not reflect 
payment of any sales charges or fees an investor may pay to purchase the securities underlying the index or index linked investments. the 
imposition of these fees and charges would cause the performance of an index linked investment to be different than the msci index performance.

material differences between back tested performance results and actual results subsequently achieved by any investment strategy.    
• 
constituents of msci equity indexes are listed companies, which are included in or excluded from the indexes according to the application 
of the relevant index methodologies. accordingly, constituents in msci equity indexes may include msci inc., clients of msci or suppliers to 
msci.  inclusion of a security within an msci index is not a recommendation by msci to buy, sell, or hold such security, nor is it considered to be 
investment advice.

data and information produced by various affiliates of msci inc., including msci esg research llc and barra llc, may be used in calculating
